# Reproducible Research

This peer assessed assignment has two parts. First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers. Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

# Description of the Shiny application
A shiny application has been created to compute the distance in kilometers between two European cities. The dataset "eurodist" has been used to obtain this information.

## Part 1: Shiny Application
1. Write a shiny application with associated supporting documentation. The documentation should be thought of as whatever a user will need to get started using your application.
2. Deploy the application on Rstudio's shiny server
3. Share the application link by pasting it into the provided text box
4. Share your server.R and ui.R code on github

## Part 2: Your Reproducible Pitch Presentation
1. 5 slides to pitch our idea done in Slidify or Rstudio Presenter
2. Your presentation pushed to github or Rpubs
3. A link to your github or Rpubs presentation pasted into the provided text box
